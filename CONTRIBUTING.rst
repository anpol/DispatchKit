Here's a quick guide.

Fork_, then clone the repo:

.. code:: sh

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/DispatchKit

Open ``DispatchKit.xcodeproj`` in Xcode. Make sure the tests pass.

Please, setup your Xcode to strip trailing whitespace,
`including whitespace-only lines <http://stackoverflow.com/a/11830067/2958047>`_.
Use `<Tools/strip-trailing-whitespace>`_ script to strip trailing whitespace from existing files.

Make your change. Follow the style of the surrounding code.

Add tests for your change. Make the tests pass.

Commit your change. Write a `good commit message`_,
describing the essence of your work on the first line,
optionally providing additional explanations on subsequent lines.

Push to your fork and `submit a pull request`_.

Wait for review. Note I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
